# Headline

The old `olt-headline` is replaced by `olt-Headline` the table below shows the mapping from the old classes to the new ones including the relevant modifiers. The new definition is longer but it's clearer and consistent with the rest of the styleguide.


```
olt-headline--xxl            olt-Headline olt-Headline--1
olt-headline--xl             olt-Headline olt-Headline--2
olt-headline--xl__regular    olt-Headline olt-Headline--2 olt-Headline--regular
olt-headline--l              olt-Headline olt-Headline--4
olt-headline--m              olt-Headline olt-Headline--5
olt-headline--s              olt-Headline olt-Headline--6
```

There is also `olt-Headline--3`. Its size is in the middle between `2` and `4`.

In contrast to the old styleguide the regular modifier `olt-Headline--regular`, which leads to a regular font weight, can be used inpedendent of the size.
